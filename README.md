# Git Scavenger Hunt

## Description

The year is 2042. A malware has infected almost all of the computers in the world, wiping out all data and rendering them useless. The only hope for humanity is to find the names of the popular open source softwares that were on the infected computers before the malware struck. These softwares contain the knowledge and tools that are essential for rebuilding civilization.

A small group of brilliant hackers, known as "The Codekeepers" assembled to develop a countermeasure, in form of a git scavenger hunt to find the names of the softwares across git repository - the last bastions of uncorrupted code. They must use their skills to search through cryptic clues, hidden messages, and ingenious riddles, challenging the brightest minds to embark on a journey to save humanity.

At the end of the day the malware had left behind a secret message, which some of the expert hackers have decrypted prior to the hunt, which may help you further to zero-down your search:

> "Unlock the secrets of versioned code,<br>
> Where history is tracked in every node.<br>
> Navigate the branches, merge with care,<br>
> And find the prize that's hidden there.<br>
> In the world of git, you'll journey far,<br>
> From commits lost to the northern star.<br>
> With commands swift and knowledge keen,<br>
> The artifact's secrets shall be seen."<br>

With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, each discovery brought the participants one step closer to deciphering the ultimate solution, hence you have to quickly report any information found as soon as possible.
